# simple_todo_backend

RESTfulAPI backend design of a simple to-do-list application with help from AI.

### Tech Stack
FastAPI, MongoDB, Python

### Note
Most of the debugging was also helped by AI. You MUST give specific code snippets and describe the situation clearly to debug/train AI better. It is useful to give the actual error message too. 
AI designed to make CRUD functions based on id, and I made create and get-all based on the id but get, update, delete by title because I thought retrieving an id would be difficult for me. I think it was a bad decision. (because at some point you need id anyway). I just followed along the AI guide-line and I think that lead to lot of wrong decision making. I believe that you should have strong thought/guideline and design before actually letting AI to do anything. AI is basically thoughtless and it doesn't have any reasoning for it's answers.
